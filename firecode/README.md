| # | Title | Description | Solution |

| 1 | Find Missing Number | Given an list containing 9 numbers ranging from 1 to 10, write a function to find the missing number. Assume you have 9 numbers between 1 to 10 and only one number is missing.| [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/findmissingnumber.py) |
| 2 | Is Palindrome | A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a Boolean -> True if the input string is a palindrome and False if it is not. An empty string is considered a palindrome. You also need to account for the space character. For example, "race car" should return False as read backward it is "rac ecar". | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/ispalindrome.py) |
| 3 | Fibonacci | The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Write a recursive method fib(n) that returns the nth Fibonacci number. n is 0 indexed, which means that in the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..., n == 0 should return 0 and n == 3 should return 2. Assume n is less than 15. | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/fibonacci.py)
| 4 | Binary Representation | Write a function to compute the binary representation of a positive decimal integer. The method should return a string.| [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/binaryrepresentation.py) |
| 5 | Horizontal Flip | You are given an m x n 2D image matrix (List of Lists) where each integer represents a pixel. Flip it in-place along its horizontal axis. | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/horizontalflip.py)
| 6 | Reverse a string | Write a function that takes in a string and returns the reversed version of the string. | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/reversestring.py)
| 7 | Repeated Elements in Array | Write a function - duplicate_items to find the redundant or repeated items in a list and return them in sorted order. This method should return a list of redundant integers in ascending sorted order | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/repeatedelements.py)
