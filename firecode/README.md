| 1 | Find Missing Number | Given an list containing 9 numbers ranging from 1 to 10, write a function to find the missing number. Assume you have 9 numbers between 1 to 10 and only one number is missing.| [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/findmissingnumber.py) |
| 2 | Is Palindrome | A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a Boolean -> True if the input string is a palindrome and False if it is not. An empty string is considered a palindrome. You also need to account for the space character. For example, "race car" should return False as read backward it is "rac ecar". | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/ispalindrome.py) |
