| 1 | Find Missing Number | Given an list containing 9 numbers ranging from 1 to 10, write a function to find the missing number. Assume you have 9 numbers between 1 to 10 and only one number is missing.| [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/findmissingnumber.py) |
| 2 | Is Palindrome | A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a Boolean -> True if the input string is a palindrome and False if it is not. An empty string is considered a palindrome. You also need to account for the space character. For example, "race car" should return False as read backward it is "rac ecar". | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/ispalindrome.py) |
| 3 | Fibonacci | The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Write a recursive method fib(n) that returns the nth Fibonacci number. n is 0 indexed, which means that in the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..., n == 0 should return 0 and n == 3 should return 2. Assume n is less than 15. | [Python](https://github.com/kiraheta/interview-technical-questions/blob/master/firecode/fibonacci.py)
