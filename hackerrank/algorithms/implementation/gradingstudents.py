"""
Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's students,
write code to automate the rounding process to the following
rules:

-If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5
is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.

-If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the
result will still be a failing grade

Sample Input:
4
73
67
38
33

Sample Output:
75
67
40
33
